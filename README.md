# PredictionModel
Hello, this is my prediction model project, with the main focus on my learning. I have tried multiple techniques for model-tuning, and I have also tried multiple machine learning models, so you can see the accuracy results of them here. I know that there is room for improvement, and of course there is. I wish I would get higher accuracy scores, but that's not the end of the world, and I will improve the model over time. (p.s. While reviewing the notebook, I've noticed some warnings pop out in the GitHub repository; however, for everybody who wants to try out my model themselves and maybe improve it or practice with it, you are free to go.) Thank you very much for reviewing my project.
